# Who am I
My name is Will Rogers. I live in Dublin, Ireland with my wife Emer and our dog. I work as a Data Scientist in Kitman Labs, a sports science company based in Dublin and California.

# Why blog

My motivation to blog is to learn. I often do a lot of self driven learning but perhaps it doesn't stick as much as I would like. I hope that by writing blogs I will have a resource to look back through in the future. Others reading the content is a bonus but also a good motivation for keeping the quality high! 

I also blog about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder over on foffocd.com. I suffer from OCD and again the goal there is to document my experiences of it - this time in a pseudo analytical way i.e. there are a lot of diagrams. I do this wo better understand the condition from which I suffer and so that in the future if needs be I can look back and might find something helpful. If others read it, then again that's a bonus.
